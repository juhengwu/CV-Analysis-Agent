# ðŸ§  CV Analysis Agent

This project uses GPT-powered agents (via [SmolAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents)) to automatically extract structured information from PDF resumes. It supports multi-agent collaboration to analyze and summarize different parts of a resume.

### âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“„ PDF parsing using PyMuPDF
- ðŸ§  LLM agents extract:
  - Basic Info (name, phone, email, location)
  - Work Experience
  - Education
  - Project Experience
  - Keywords / Skills
  - HR-style Commentary
- ðŸ’¬ Returns a consistent JSON schema for each resume
- ðŸ§ª Supports batch testing on multiple PDFs

### ðŸš€ Get Started

This project is designed for use inside a **Jupyter Notebook**.

1. Clone this repo and open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Place your resume(s) in the `test/` folder (PDF format).
3. Run the notebook â€” each agent will process the resume and output a structured JSON.
4. You can modify or replace the resume files to test different outputs.

No command-line required â€” just open the notebook and go!

### ðŸ“Š Results

Below are example outputs from different resumes (automatically generated by the agents):

More test cases are under `test/` and `output/` 

This project was built for experimentation and educational use â€” not yet production-ready.
