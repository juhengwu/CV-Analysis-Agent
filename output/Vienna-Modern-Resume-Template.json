    "comment": "The resume is quite professional with a clear layout and presents relevant experiences. Janine has effectively highlighted her contributions, such as significant sales growth and technical program design, demonstrating clear value to previous employers. However, the resume would benefit from more consistent formatting (e.g., alignment, bullet points) and using numbers more consistently, such as in the employment history section to quantify achievements. Additionally, providing more precise dates or durations would offer better clarity on timeline and experience."
