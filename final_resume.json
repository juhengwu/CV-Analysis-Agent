The layout is straightforward, and key successes, such as the 30% growth in income and significant sales increases, are well highlighted. However, the employment dates for the position at Engen Oil seem incorrect, suggesting a need for careful proofreading. Additionally, more quantitative data regarding responsibilities and outcomes could further illustrate the candidate's impact."
