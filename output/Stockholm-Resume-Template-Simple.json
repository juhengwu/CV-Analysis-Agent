The candidate has effectively communicated quantifiable achievements, such as error rates and productivity improvements, adding credibility to their skills. However, the layout could benefit from clearer separation of sections and a concise skill list to enhance readability. Additionally, reducing repetition of 'Cleaning Equipment' under skills can help avoid redundancy."
